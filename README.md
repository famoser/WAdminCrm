# WAdminCrm
a flavour of a generic WebAdmin Framework. This edition enables projekt management.
It is currently in use, so I've excluded the common/configuration.php file.
You may change the values in common/configuration_public.php as it fits the needs of your application and then rename it to configuration.php
